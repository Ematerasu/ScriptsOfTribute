## Coding Conventions
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions

## Project Structure
In this solution we have two projects:
* TalesOfTribute Engine
* Tests for the engine

Tests are divided into Unit tests and functional tests, but propably we won't user functional tests that much.
In Tests project there is TemplateTestfile.cs to use as a template to not worry about configuration but to focus on testing.

## Git conventions
Please don't push straight to master thanks
